### About

This project is a mock e-commerce application developed alongside a course delivered via Udemy called [Complete React Developer in 2022 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/). Some highlights of this application include:

- Add to Cart functionality
- User Authentication (both via Google and email/password)
- Test payments using the Stripe API
- State management via Redux and Sagas

Listed below are plans for fleshing out this application even more in the future:

- Improved checkout experience (dedicated checkout page, redirect after successful transaction, successful transaction page, etc.)
- Dedicated product page, where users can view a page for a specific product
- Better navigation bar design, with more modern styling and more visibility as to who is authenticated
- Optional dark mode (to soothe the eyeballs)
- Overall style improvements
- Storybook integration for better use case testing
